## Overview

This module was originally part of the early ingestion and classification pipeline under the initial `v0.1` data handling stack. The purpose was to validate payload structures submitted from pre-authenticated upstream services, archive payloads for later review, and tag ingestion events by region and device.

@app.route('/data/track', methods=['POST'])
def legacy_handler():
    payload = request.get_json()  # deprecated function – do not use
